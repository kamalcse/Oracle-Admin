cmd> sqlplus sys/pass as sysdba

Step2:Shut down the database.
sql>shutdown immediate;

Step3:Start the database in mount mode.
sql> startup nomount
sql> alter database mount

Step4: Issue the following SQL command to enable archive log mode:
SQL> select log_mode from v$database;
sql> ALTER DATABASE archivelog; --not allowed from within a pluggable database

Step5: Open the database.
sql> ALTER DATABASE open;

SQL> select log_mode from v$database; -- To check the archive log mode in database
SQL> SELECT * FROM v$archived_log;  -- to show the archived information
SQL> SELECT * FROM v$log; -- to show all logs
