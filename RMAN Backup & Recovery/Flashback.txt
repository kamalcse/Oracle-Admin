#Rewinding a Database with Flashback Database: database must have been previously configured to generate flashback logs.
SQL> SELECT flashback_on FROM v$database;
SQL> ALTER DATABASE FLASHBACK ON;
--You cannot use theflashback database to repair media failures or missing data files.
1. Start RMAN and connect to a target database.
2. Ensure that the database is in a mounted state.
SQL> SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
SQL> STARTUP MOUNT;

3. Run the FLASHBACK DATABASE command. The following examples illustrate different forms of the command:
FLASHBACK DATABASE TO SCN 861150;
FLASHBACK DATABASE TO RESTORE POINT BEFORE_CHANGES;
FLASHBACK DATABASE TO TIMESTAMP TO_DATE(04-DEC-2009 03:30:00','DD-MON-YYYY HH24:MI:SS');

4. After performing the Flashback Database, open the database read-only in SQL*Plus and
run some queries to verify the database contents.
Open the database read-only as follows:
ALTER DATABASE OPEN READ ONLY;

5. If satisfied with the results, then issue the following sequence of commands to shut down
and then open the database:
SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
STARTUP MOUNT;
ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS;
