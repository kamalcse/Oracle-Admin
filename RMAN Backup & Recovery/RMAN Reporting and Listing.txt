#Listing Backups:
RMAN>show all;  -- show the RMAN default configuration
RMAN> LIST BACKUP [OF options]; -- This is the default mode of presentation.
RMAN> LIST BACKUPSET [OF options] -- show the list of backup sets.
RMAN> LIST BACKUP OF DATABASE [BY BACKUP]; -- Organizes the output by backup set. This is the default mode of presentation.

LIST BACKUP OF DATABASE;
LIST COPY OF DATAFILE 1, 2;
LIST BACKUP OF ARCHIVELOG FROM SEQUENCE 10;
LIST BACKUPSET OF DATAFILE 1;

RMAN> LIST COPY; -- Lists all image copies of database files.
RMAN> LIST COPY SUMMARY;
RMAN> LIST DATAFILECOPY [all | like | tag | double-quoted-string | integer | single-quoted-string];
RMAN> LIST ARCHIVELOG [all | from | high | like | low | scn | sequence | time | until | double-quoted-string | integer | single-quoted-string]; --Lists all archived redo logs.

RMAN> LIST INCARNATION;  --Lists all database incarnations available in the RMAN repository.
RMAN> LIST FAILURE; --Lists all recorded backup and restore failures.

#Reporting on Database Files and Backups: The REPORT command performs more complex reporting analysis than the LIST
command
RMAN> REPORT NEED BACKUP DATABASE; --Shows which files need backing up under current retention policy. 
RMAN> REPORT OBSOLETE; --Lists backups that are obsolete under the configured backup retention policy.
RMAN> REPORT SCHEMA; --Reports the tablespaces and data files in the database at the current time (default) or a different time.
RMAN> REPORT UNRECOVERABLE; --Lists all data files for which an unrecoverable operation has been performed against an object in the data file since the last backup of the data file.
