--=====================Oracle Database Recovery Steps===============================--
Two options in Oracle for recovering physical files:
Use RMAN to restore the Oracle database.
Operate OS utilities to restore backups, and then execute SQL*Plus RECOVER command.

1.Start the RMAN client and connect to the target database as a user to check if there are any connection issues.
cmd>rman
RMAN> connect target sys
or
cmd> rman target sys/pass@dbname
cmd> rman target /
cmd> rman target sysbackup/password@database_name

2.Identify the files to restore.

The lost control file will immediately shut down the database, although some copy loss doesn’t need to recover the file from backup. 
Go to step 6 to see the recovery process.

Determine missing data file:
RMAN> VALIDATE DATABASE;

3.Preview backups for recovery.

RESTORE DATABASE PREVIEW;

To specify information if there is too much.

RESTORE DATABASE PREVIEW SUMMARY;

 4.     Validate the backups to see if they are usable.

RESTORE ... VALIDATEtests whether RMAN can recover a given object from a backup.

VALIDATE BACKUPSET tests whether a backup set you specify is valid.

5.     Provide passwords for the encrypted backup.

SET DECRYPTION IDENTIFIED BY password;

6.     Restore the control file from RMAN backups.

You need to restore and mount the control file if all copies of it are unavailable. Run the RECOVER command, then boot the database with the RESETLOGS.
If the RMAN connects to a recovery catalog, repeat the steps for restoring the current control file. And set the DBID if the DB name is not unique.
If it doesn’t, restore a control file from autobackup.

a) Get the DBID, the number after “ctl_c-“, based on the control file name.
RMAN> SET DBID 00000;

b) Start the Oracle DB in nomount mode.
RMAN> STARTUP NOMOUNT;

c) Restore the controlfile from the RMAN autobackup.
RMAN> RESTORE CONTROLFILE FROM AUTOBACKUP;

d) Mount the database after recovery.
RMAN> ALTER DATABASE MOUNT;

e) Recover the database and reset the online logs.
RMAN> RECOVER DATABASE;
RMAN> ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS;

7.Restore the archived redo logs (database is mounted or open).

The default location.
RMNAN> RESTORE ARCHIVELOG ALL;

To a new location.
RMNAN> SET ARCHIVELOG DESTINATION TO 'LOCATIONPATH';
RMNAN> RESTORE ARCHIVELOG ALL;

Chosen archive logs from 100 to 200,
RMNAN> RESTORE ARCHIVELOG FROM SEQUENCE 100 UNTIL SEQUENCE 200;

8.Restore Oracle database from RMAN full backup.

RMAN> RESTORE DATABASE;

9.Restore only specific tablespace (one and more).

a)Take recovery database offline.
ALTER TABLESPACE users OFFLINE IMMEDIATE;

b)Use “SHOW ALL” to see channels that are preconfigured, if not, use “CONFIGURE” to set up automatic channels.

c）Restore.
RMNAN> RESTORE TABLESPACE EXAMPLE;
RMNAN> RESTORE TABLESPACE EXAMPLE 1, EXAMPLE 2;

To new locations:
SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE 'PATH1' TO 'PATH2';

10.Restore only specific datafiles (one and more).
RMNAN> RESTORE DATAFILE 'FILENAME'
RMNAN> RESTORE DATAFILE 'FILENAME1', 'FILENAME2'
