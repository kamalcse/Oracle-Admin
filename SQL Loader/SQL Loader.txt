--SQL*Loader allows you to load data from an external file into a table in the database
SQL*Loader provides the following methods to load data:

1.Conventional path loads – construct INSERT statements from the contents of the input datafile based on the predefined specification and execute the inserts.
2.Direct path loads – creates data blocks in Oracle database block format from the datafile and directly write the data block to the database. This way is much faster than the conventional path but subject to some restrictions.
3.External table loads – create an external table for the data stored in the datafile and execute INSERT statements to insert the data from the datafile into the target table. The external table loads support parallel loading if datafile is big enough.

To execute the SQL*Load tool, you need at least three files
1.The input data file - stores delimited or raw data
2.The parameter file - stores the location of the input/output files
3.The control file contains - the specification on how data is loaded

Example of SQL Loader:
--email.dat file: Data file
	1,john.doe@example.com
	2,jane.doe@example.com
	3,peter.doe@example.com
--email.ctl file: Control File
	load data into table emails
	insert
	fields terminated by ","
	(
	email_id,
	email
	)
Parameter file (email.par):
	userid=ot@pdborc/Abcd1234
	control=email.ctl
	log=email.log
	bad=email.bad
	data=email.dat
	direct=true
