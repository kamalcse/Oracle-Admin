alter session set container=PDBNAME; -- to select a PDB for pluggable database
alter session set container=XEPDB1; 

--=========== Create New User/Schema =============--
--Basic Syntax
SQL>CREATE USER <username> -- username
	IDENTIFIED BY <password>  -- Password
   	[DEFAULT TABLESPACE <tablespace_name>] -- tablespace name
	[QUOTA {<size> | UNLIMITED} ON <tablespace_name>] --Specify the maximum of space in the tablespace that the user can use. You can have multiple QUOTA clauses, each for a tablespace.
    	[PROFILE <profile_name>]  --A user profile limits the database resources or password that the user cannot exceed
	[PASSWORD EXPIRE] --to force the user to change the password for the first time
	[ACCOUNT {LOCK | UNLOCK}];

-- check the users of database
SQL>SELECT username, default_tablespace, profile, authentication_type
FROM    dba_users WHERE account_status = 'OPEN';

--To enable the user to log in
SQL> GRANT CREATE SESSION TO john;

--============= to connect to oracle database:=================
cmd>sqlplus <username>/<password>@service_name
or
cmd>sqlplus <username>/<password>@//host:port/service_name
or
sqlplus / as sysdba
sqlplus <username>/<password> as sysdba
or
sqlplus <enter>
Enter user-name: your_username
Enter password: your_password
or
cmd>sqlplus /nolog
SQL> connect <user>/<password>@<db_name>
or
SQL> connect <user>@<db_name>/<password>

---=============== Grant Permission================
SQL> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO <user_name>; -- to grant all permission to a user
--System privileges: CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE PROCEDURE, SYSDBA, SYSOPER
--Object privileges: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, INDEX, EXECUTE

SQL>GRANT {system_privileges | object_privileges } TO user [WITH ADMIN OPTION]
--WITH ADMIN OPTION: Grant / revoke/alter/drop the privilege to / from another user.
SQL>GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO <user>; -- to give permission to any table
SQL> GRANT SELECT ON <table_name> TO {user | role}; -- to Grant SELECT on a table to a user/ role
SQL> SELECT * FROM session_privs;
SQL> ALTER USER <user> QUOTA UNLIMITED ON <table_space>;


--- Revoke Permission
SQL> REVOKE {system_privilege | object_privilege } FROM user;

---ALTER USER
SQL> ALTER USER <user_name> IDENTIFIED BY xyz123; ---to change the password
SQL> ALTER USER <user_name> ACCOUNT LOCK|UNLOCK; --- to lock/unlock a user
sql> ALTER USER <user_name> PASSWORD EXPIRE; --- to set userâ€™s password expired
SQL> ALTER USER <user_name> PROFILE <profile_name>; ---to set default profile to a user
SQL> ALTER USER dolphin DEFAULT ROLE super; -- to set default role to a user

--- Droping user
SQL> DROP USER username [CASCADE]; -- Oracle does not drop roles created by the user even after it deletes the user.

--- Unlock a user
-- to unlock a user, First, log in to the Oracle Database as a SYS user
SQL> ALTER USER username IDENTIFIED BY password ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
-- if unlock an account without resetting the password, then the password remains expired.


----To Create/Grant/ Alter/Drop Roles
SQL> CREATE ROLE <role_name> [IDENTIFIED BY password] [NOT IDENTIFIED] -- to create a role
SQL> GRANT {system_privileges | object_privileges} TO <role_name>; -- to grant privileges to a role
SQL> GRANT <role_name> TO <another_role_name>;  -- to grant privileges of a role to another role.
SQL> SET ROLE <role_name> [IDENTIFIED BY password];  -- enable the role by specific user
SQL> SET ROLE role1, role2 IDENTIFIED BY password,...; -- to enable multiple role. It cannot enable more than 148 user-defined roles at one time.
SQL> SET ROLE ALL; -- To enable all roles previously granted to your account. It will not enable the roles with passwords
SQL> SET ROLE ALL EXCEPT <except_role>; --  to enable all roles except for a role
SQL> SET ROLE NONE; -- to disable all roles of a user.
SQL> ALTER ROLE <role_name> { NOT IDENTIFIED | IDENTIFIED BY password } -- To execute the ALTER ROLE statement, your account must either have been granted the role with ADMIN OPTION or have the ALTER ANY ROLE system privilege.
	-- not possible to change a NOT IDENTIFIED role to a IDENTIFIED BY password role if the role has been granted to another role.
SQL> DROP ROLE role_name; -- to delete a role and revokes it from all users and roles. To drop a role, you must have the DROP ANY ROLE system privilege or have been granted the role with the ADMIN OPTION.

----To Create/Grant/ Alter/Drop Profile
---A user profile is a set of limits on the database resources and the user password. Once you assign a profile to a user, then that user cannot exceed the database resource and password limits.
SQL> CREATE PROFILE profile_name LIMIT { resource_parameters | password_parameters}; --to create a new user profile

--ALTER PROFILE statement allows you to add, change, or delete a resource limit or password management parameter in a user profile.
SQL> ALTER PROFILE <profile_name> LIMIT { resource_parameters | password_parameters};
SQL> DROP PROFILE profile_name [CASCADE];
